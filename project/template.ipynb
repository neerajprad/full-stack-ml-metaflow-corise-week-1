    "\n",
    "ModaMetric is a budding star in the eCommerce landscape, gaining rapid popularity among customers for its unique and stylish fashion offerings. However, they've faced a bottleneck: understanding their customers' sentiments from the ocean of reviews and feedback they receive daily. Your role as a member of ModaMetric's data science team is pivotal in solving this issue. Your mission? To implement an effective sentiment analysis model that can sift through the plethora of customer reviews and provide actionable insights.\n",

    "As ModaMetric's newly onboarded data scientist, you're entrusted with an exciting challenge. The data science team, still in its infancy, has primarily focused on metrics and analytics that provide surface-level insights. They've yet to delve into the rich, unstructured data residing in customer reviews. And that's where you step in. Your job is to design and implement a machine learning pipeline using Metaflow capable of performing sentiment analysis on the customer reviews.\n",

Through this process, we will be looking out for trends, anomalies, and outliers that can help us better understand the data and inform our decision-making in subsequent stages of the project.

    "### The ModaMetric Challenge: Beyond the Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "At ModaMetric, your initial explorations have been fruitful. You've established a baseline sentiment analysis model, and the team is abuzz with excitement. However, the baseline model is only the beginning. Your next mission is to create a more sophisticated model that outperforms the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eCommerce world moves at breakneck speed, and ModaMetric is no exception. Rapid iterations and quick feedback are the need of the hour. As you strive to improve the model, keep in mind the balance between complexity and practicality. More complex deep neural networks might offer higher accuracy, but they require GPUs for inference, which adds to the overhead. Simpler models, on the other hand, might have lower accuracy but can be deployed quickly and cost-effectively on CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you embark on this task, consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given the balance between accuracy and deployability, what model do you think is good enough to get the ball rolling at ModaMetric?\n",
    "2. Try to implement your choice in a new Metaflow Flow, `GoodFirstModelNLPFlow`.\n",
    "3. Can you confirm that `GoodFirstModelNLPFlow` performs better than `BaselineNLPFlow`? Metaflow's Client API can help you validate this. You can refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/client).\n",
    "4. Did `GoodFirstModelNLPFlow` outperform `BaselineNLPFlow`? If yes, why do you think it did? If not, what might be the reasons for not reaching the expected performance?\n",
    "5. Reflect on the importance of quick iterations in ML projects, especially in the context of ModaMetric's fast-paced environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This optional task offers a chance to deepen your understanding of machine learning workflows, testing your ability to innovate and improvise in a real-world scenario. Remember, every step forward is a step towards ModaMetric's success!\n"
