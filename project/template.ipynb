    "Welcome to an exhilarating journey into the world of machine learning! This week, you're stepping into the shoes of a data scientist at ModaMetric, an eCommerce startup specializing in bespoke women's fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The ModaMetric Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "ModaMetric is a budding star in the eCommerce landscape, gaining rapid popularity among customers for its unique and stylish fashion offerings. However, they've faced a bottleneck: understanding their customers' sentiments from the ocean of reviews and feedback they receive daily. Your role as a member of ModaMetric's data science team is pivotal in solving this issue. Your mission? To implement an effective sentiment analysis model that can sift through the plethora of customer reviews and provide actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Role: A Pioneer Data Scientist at ModaMetric\n",
    "\n",
    "As ModaMetric's newly onboarded data scientist, you're entrusted with an exciting challenge. The data science team, still in its infancy, has primarily focused on metrics and analytics that provide surface-level insights. They've yet to delve into the rich, unstructured data residing in customer reviews. And that's where you step in. Your job is to design and implement a machine learning pipeline using Metaflow capable of performing sentiment analysis on the customer reviews.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the assignment:\n",
    "1. Fill in the TODO sections of this notebook.\n",
    "2. Push the results to your `full-stack-ml-metaflow-corise-week-1` repository.\n",
    "3. Create a link to the repository in Corise.\n"

This dataset closely mirrors the data that ModaMetric gathers. Your first task involves understanding the structure, variables, and potential quirks of this dataset. Remember, knowing your data is the first step in any data science project!\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data science pipeline as it allows us to gain insights and identify patterns within the data. In this section, we will be performing EDA on the Women's Clothing E-Commerce dataset, which contains reviews written by customers. Through this process, we will be looking out for trends, anomalies, and outliers that can help us better understand the data and inform our decision-making in subsequent stages of the project. By performing EDA, we will be able to identify potential issues with the dataset and make necessary corrections before proceeding to the model building phase.\n",
